# Notebook Implementation for the Kaggle Contest Jigsaw Multilingual

An attempt to refresh my NLP knowledge, starting out from the basics; RNNs to fancy pancy Transformer architectures.

Plan :
RNN, LSTMs, Attention, Char level embeddings, Graph embeddings, other novel embedding mabe, BERT, Ensemble, Few/Zero Shot Learning(Have no clue how it works yet)
